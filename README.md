# **My Tribute Page Readme!**

> I chose the subject of the *Kagu* since it is my faviourite bird and thus my faviorite animal. It is for this reason it was selected to be my tribute. 
### What Did I Learn
> Whilst undergoing this challenge, I learnt a lot about HTML and CSS. I had to follow the Codecademy tutorials in order to overcome some hurdles. I really enjoyed learning about all the different ways one can interact with options and settings within the Style Sheet to get the look you are looking for. 

### Reflections?

> I believe that there is still a very long way to go in order to make my page look decent and have more functionality. I would really like to begin adding Javascript into my project, however I still believe there is a more learning I need to delve into before I can achieve this! I also would like to take the liberty of adding that I may have misunderstood the second-to-last task! I will build upon this!
