            <p id="tribute-info">The Kagu is a highly unusual, flightless bird - which is known locally as the "Ghost of the Forest" (A pretty cool name). <br> They are also the only representative
            of an entire taxonomic family, as the Kagu resembles something between a small heron <br> and a rail. It shares its taxonomic order with  one other species, which is also
            the only representative of its family, the sunbitten.</p>
            <p id="tribute-info">This species is endemic to Grand Terre, the largest island of New Caledonia and has been adopted as the national emblem.<br> The Kagu has experienced a sharp decline in numbers
            during the 1900s as a direct result of predation by invasive species.<br> Following this predation bydogs and cats - the Kagu is now listed as Endangered.</p>
